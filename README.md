# Detecting vandalism on Wikipedia (Text Analytics)
   One of the consequences of being editable by anyone is that some people vandalize pages. This can take the form of removing content, adding promotional or inappropriate content, or more subtle shifts that change the meaning of the article. With this many articles and edits per day it is difficult for humans to detect all instances of vandalism and revert (undo) them. In this project we develop a machine learning algorithm to detect vandalism using CART in R.
